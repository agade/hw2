		<p>
			I am from a Waverly, IA. It is a smaller farm town, but still has a lot of big city perks.  I am the second of two kids.
			My parents are Dave & Becki.  I have an older brother, Isaac, who is an Assistant Manager at a new Fareway store in West Des Moines.
		</p>
	
		<p> 
			I started working at Fareway myself when I was 14 yrs old. I worked there 8 years, until I took a position at the University of Iowa
			in the Information Technology Services department. I worked there for just over a year until I interned at McGladrey last summer.  I currently still
			work there part-time.
		</p>
	
		<p>
			I spent four years in the Hawkeye Marching Band.  I had blast going to all the home games and several away games each of those years.
			The three free southern vacations for bowl trips weren't too bad either.<br><br>
			In addition to the Hawkeyes, I am a die hard Yankees fan.  I'm also quite the LeBron James fan as well (Even though I get a lot of
			criticism for it).<br>
			In my free time I enjoy playing catch, basketball, or messing with electronics.  I have built several PC's for/with friends, and I like to "toy"
			things to see what we can make happen.
